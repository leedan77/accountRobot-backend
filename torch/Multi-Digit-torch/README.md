# SVHN-Multi-Digit-torch
Torch implementation of Multi-digit Number Recognition from Street View Imagery using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6082.pdf)

The trained model can be downloaded from - 
http://www.terminet.xyz/datasets/model.zip

The trained model achieves 95.4% accuracy on the test set and was trained for 3 days.

Run eval.lua to classify a single input image.

Requirements:
* optim
* nn
* cudnn, cunn, cutorch
* dp
* rnn
